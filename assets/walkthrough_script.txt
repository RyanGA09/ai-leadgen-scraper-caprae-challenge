🎤 **Opening**
Hi, this is Ryan Gading Abdullah and this is a quick walkthrough of my submission for the Caprae Capital internship pre-work.

---
🧑‍💻 **What I Built**
I’ve built a Python-based lead generation tool that scrapes Google search results for companies and their contact information.
It uses Selenium to extract the page title, URL, and any visible emails.

---
📓 **Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough**
As recommended in the brief, I’ve also included a Jupyter Notebook demo:
- It walks through the scraping and email extraction logic step-by-step
- Useful for testing and visualizing results without launching the full tool
- I used it to prototype and debug the scraping process more efficiently

File: `scraper_selenium.ipynb`

---
🖥️ **Demo (Selenium)**
Let me show you the CLI version.
- I input the search query (e.g., "AI startup San Francisco") and number of results.
- The tool runs headlessly using Chrome, fetches search results, and visits each one to extract emails.
- Once finished, the results are saved to a CSV file: `leads_selenium.csv`

---
🌐 **Demo (Streamlit)**
I also added a simple web interface using Streamlit:
- You can enter keywords and number of leads to find.
- Click search, and results will show up in a table.
- There’s also a download button to export results.

---
📂 **Files**
The project includes:
- CLI scraper (`scraper_selenium.py`)
- Streamlit UI (`streamlit_app_selenium.py`)
- Jupyter Notebook walkthrough + debugging (`scraper_selenium.ipynb`)
- CSV output
- README, report, and this script

✅ **Closing**
Thanks for reviewing my submission. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

End of script.
